After deciding to pick up coding seriously earlier this year I finally started my first project. 

The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning algorithm that could detect
common math mistakes. This porject is aimed mainly toward middle- and high school students with simple arithmetic problems.

Initially I had a tough time finding data, so I decided to create my own. problem_generator_with_OOP.py does just this. 
This was good practice for learning python, especially OOP, which I implemented in the code after (mostly) finishing the generator without OOP.

After the generator was done, I needed to create an algorithm, which is what CountMeOut.py does. 
Cleaning data (even though it was my own creation) proved to be my biggest challenge. 
This file taught me a lot about data cleaning, and different types of ML models.

Possible Improvements:
- Adding more variation in possible_reasons in generator 
- Adding different types of problems (algebraic, calculus, more complex arithmetic, for example (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2)
My hope for this project is this could eventually be used in undergraduate level mathematics proofs to help students identify where they might've went wrong
